A perl program that pre-renders a content file as a series of offsets and
lengths (to be consumed by writev).  Format of the file is as follows:

FILE_FORMAT

HEADER
4B - Number of rows
4B - OFFSET to string table
4B - OFFSET to unique cells (see below section)
4B - OFFSET to vectors


STRING_TABLE
# a series of length + string pairs.  Comes in 2 sizes

# small
1B - length
NB - data

# large
4B - length
NB - data

# we differentiate between the two by the most significant bit (which comes
# first as we're storing big endian).  If:
1 - 31 bit length
0 - 7 bit length


UNIQUE_CELLS
# unique sets of static and dyanmic content shared among rows.  Usually one per
# included dynamic content

4B - Number of total cells in the row
4B - Number of cells in the vector table (I.e. dyanmic components)
NB - N = the first field.  Offsets into the string table.  If value = 3 << 30,
     value is in the vector, otherwise static. See STRING_TABLE_POINTERS.

VECTORS
# The dynamic row data.

4B - Offset into the UNIQUE_CELLS table
NB - STRING_TABLE_POINTERS for dyanmic values


STRING_TABLE_POINTERS
Each string table pointer is a 32 bit unsigned int offset into the string
table.  Values are all one higher than needed, so we adjust down.

and in the unique cell data
0 - pointer can be found in the vector data.  Thus why the other points are 1
    greater
